# Neo4j

After installation, create a new database.
Give it a name... then click on `Add` and then choose `Local DBMS`, then assign a name and password and then click on `Create` and finally `Start` the database.
As you see, inside the database management system, we have two databases: System (which is not activated and is colored in gray) and Neo4j (default). We have to connect these two databases. Gor to the left side of the window and click on `Graph Apps` which is an icon with four squares. Then click on `Neo4j Browser` and type `neo4j$ MATCH (n) RETURN n`
